# formulaConquerer

formula Conqueror is a python calculator essentially. but it goes a step further and teaches you how to solve the problems you put into it.

##History of FormulaConqueror
Jon McLaren created ForumlaConqueror originally to do his math homework for him not just showing the answer but the showing the work, then after showing the program to a math tutor realized it could be used as a teaching aid.

##Hope for future
It'd be great if one day someone were to port this or atleast the concept of this app to phones and graphing calculators that would be awesome.


Thank you,

Jon McLaren
