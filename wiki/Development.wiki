==Development==
Obviously this program needs more stuff, and I've planned on having other people help make modules to make it better. I've made a few functions to help you out with making your modules and modifying current ones.

The program was made in python and I will not accept revisions or changes made in any other language.

===Special Functions===
I have imported into the program the Math Module
the documentation can be found at
http://docs.python.org/library/math.html

||newline(x)||adds x amount of line breaks||
||end()||its a smooth way to exit your module it's kind of required||




Tips:
Please test your modules before sending them in.


Please comment if you would like a function to be added that would make module making easier. I want this program to be really easy for all to develop, even those who don't know Python.
