            <p>Formula Conqueror was a project Jon built in high school to help get homework done faster because he hated doing it.</p>
            <p>The program not only answered questions it showed the work to arrive at the answer enabling Jon to just copy it all down to do his homework.</p>
            <p>This was Jon's first useful program.</p>
            <p>This project is like a time capsule, allowing people today to use the program like it was back in the day.</p>
